# Machine-Learning-Algorithm
My Extensive Documentation on the Different Machine Learning Algorithms and Techniques.
### Overview
This repository documents my learning progress with all the machine learning algorithms and techniques. I wanted to make this as simple as possible to understand so i added readme files in every folder to understand the pros and cons of each algorithm from my perspective, as well as when and how it should be used.
